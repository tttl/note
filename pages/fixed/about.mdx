Hi, I'm Trent.

A web developer and currently located in China.

Write code is only hobby of my life when I was a kid, I like this felling about creating things as maker. When i grow up, rugby also brings some passion for me, fighting is one of the most wonderful things in this world.

By the way, the uses of this blog are for record some thoughts, stories and ideas.
You can ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tttl_te) if you need contact me, that's all.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
